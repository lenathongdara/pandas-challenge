    "# ☆ Charter schools stand out with higher average scores and a greater percentage of students passing in both math and reading. \n",
    "# ☆ Schools with a student population of 2000 or less and those with a budget of $615 or lower per student demonstrate higher average scores and passing rates. \n",
    "# ☆ Average math and reading scores remain relatively consistent across different grade levels when grouped by school. However, math passing rates consistently lag behind reading passing rates, particularly in lower-performing schools, large schools, and those with higher spending per student. \n",
    "# ☆ The top-performing schools are all charters, while the bottom-performing schools are all district schools. Surprisingly, higher spending per student does not necessarily translate to better test results. \n",
    "# ☆ Smaller and medium-sized schools outperform larger schools in passing math performances significantly. Charter schools outperform public district schools across all metrics, but further analysis is required to determine whether this effect is due to school practices or smaller student populations per school. \n",
    "# ☆ Overall, these insights provide valuable information for educators and the city's school district to make informed decisions in improving educational outcomes for students."
